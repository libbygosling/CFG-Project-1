            Malala Yousafzai is an advocate for female education and the
            youngest Nobel Peace Prize Laureate. In early 2009 at just 11 years old
            she wrote anonymously for BBC Urdu about her life under during the
            Pakistani Taliban occupation of Swat. She rose to prominence in the
            news, and was nominated for a Children's Peace Prize by Desmond
            Tutu. On 9th October 2012 while on a bus after taking an exam,
            herself and two other females were shot by a Pakistani Taliban
            Gunman in retaliation to her activism. Malala was shot in the head.
            Following her recovery in the UK she co-funded the 'Malala Fund' and
            became an education rights hero. She finished her high school
            education and went to Oxford University.
